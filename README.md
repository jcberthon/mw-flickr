mw-flickr
=========

A WordPress plugin which adds a simple widget to display some small pictures from a flickr account (random, most interesting, etc.).

It is a modernized version of the defunct Flickr Badge which allowed embedding some small thumbnails in our blogs.

Description
-----------

This plugin aim at providing an integration of Flickr services (Collections, Sets, Groups, Tags, etc.) with-in a WordPress site.

The current features are:
* Flickr photos widget: a WordPress theme widget than can be added to compatible themes. The widget allows to display in a sidebar photos
  * from a user only for the moment
  * you can select the number of photos, their size
  * you can filter photos by a tag

_Note: it is now possible to use 2 different back-ends for the photos widget. Either the legacy Flickr Badge javascript service (which does not seem to be supported by Flickr anymore but it is still working). Or the Flickr API directly, but it does not offer a perfect match to the JS service._
